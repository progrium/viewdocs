# Example page

Hello there! This is an example documentation page for [Viewdocs](http://viewdocs.io), a super-lightweight project documentation platform inspired by [Gist.io](http://gist.io).

Now look up. _Further_. Above the post title. See that grey text?

Now back to me. That grey text is a link! Open that sucker in a new tab to see the project for this documentation.

## This is a major heading

If you peek at it with a web inspector, you'll see that it is a second-level heading. You can use first level headings, but they'll look just like the second level ones, and the gods of the [HTML5 outlining algorithm](http://html5doctor.com/outlines/) will frown upon you.

There's nothing stopping you from using `H3`, `H4`, or `H5`. They are all appropriately styled with a nod to [Bringhurst](http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Typographic-Style-Robert-Bringhurst/dp/0881791326), and you can check out a preview of how they look below.

### This is a third-level heading

Classy, eh? Those are actually real small-caps, courtesy of the lovely argentine typeface, [Alegreya](http://www.huertatipografica.com.ar/tipografias/alegreya/ejemplos.html) (available from Google webfonts in [regular](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Alegreya) and [small-caps](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Alegreya+SC) variants). Here, have some [slipsum](http://slipsum.com) in a `<blockquote>`:

> Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.

#### This is a fourth-level heading

Down here we are quite in the weeds already. I guess this is a good a time as any to say that lists are appropriately styled:

##### Milkshake ingredients to get at the supermarket

* Bananas
* Cocoa
* Milk

_Add bananas, chocolate milk powder, and milk to blender. Blend at high-speed until suitably frothy. Drink and then instagram a pic of your milkshake moustache for extra hipster cool points or something._

##### Steps to recovery from milkshake addiction

1. Discard your blender to remove temptation.
2. Don't make milkshakes.
3. Repeat step 2 until unreasonable desire for milkshakes has abated.

By the way, the "Milkshakes ingredients" subtitle was a fifth-level heading. It's rare that you need those, and I don't think you'll ever need a H6, so I didn't style those at all.

Since you've come this far, you are probably wondering why I don't support something you want me to support. You can help make Viewdocs better by [contributing to the project](https://github.com/progrium/viewdocs) or [filing a bug/feature request](https://github.com/progrium/viewdocs/issues).

## Also: images

You can embed images in posts too, and they'll respect the width of your browser:
